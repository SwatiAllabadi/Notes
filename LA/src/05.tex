\section{Topics Covered}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item  PA = LU (Section 2.7) (covered in notes of lecture 4)
    \item  Vector spaces and sub spaces (Section 3.1) 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Vector Spaces}
Examples of vectors spaces: \newline
$R^2$ = all real valued 2-dimensional vectors (or say) all vectors with 2 components (or)  the x-y plane \newline
Similarly, $R^n$ = all column vectors with n components
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
3 \\
-2\\
\end{bmatrix}
\] is a vector in $R^2$ while 

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
3 \\
-2\\
0\\
\end{bmatrix}
\] is a vector in $R^3$.

\textbf{Vector space has to be closed under addition and multiplication.}

\textbf{Subspace of $R^2$} %= vector space of $R^2$.
For a line to be subspace in $R^2$, the line must pass though origin else it won't satisfy the properties of a vector space.

\newline
\textbf{Various subspaces of $R^2$}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $R^2$ itself. (plane)
    \item any line through \[
\begin{bmatrix}
0\\
0\\
\end{bmatrix}
\] (L)
    \item zero vector (Z)
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Various subspaces of $R^3$}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $R^3$ itself. 
    \item any line through \[
\begin{bmatrix}
0\\
0\\
0\\
\end{bmatrix}
\] (L)
    \item any plane through \[
\begin{bmatrix}
0\\
0\\
0\\
\end{bmatrix}
\]
    \item zero vector (Z)
    
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{How to create a subspace from a matrix?}\newline
Let A  = \[
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 3\\
2& 3\\
4 & 1\\
\end{bmatrix}
\]
All the linear combinations of columns of A form a subspace. Called as \textbf{column subspace}, C(A). This subspace is a plane passing through the origin. If the 2 columns of A were lying on the same line, then we would have got that line as subspace instead of plane.
Since columns of A are vectors in $R^3$, the vectors in subspace obtained from it are vectors in $R^3$.
\newline
Let's say we have 5 vectors in $R^{10}$. What is the subspace formed by these vectors? \newline
We won't get $R^5$ because these vectors have 10 components, not 5. We might get a 5-d flat thing passing through origin. If those 5 vectors lie on the same line, then we will only get a line passing through origin.
